## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `libs`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management
**Read the dependencies document first to the end**
